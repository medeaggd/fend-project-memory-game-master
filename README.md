## Instructions

Once the page loads, an alert box will prompt the user if ready to begin the game. Accepting will start the timer, not accepting will let the user know they must begin the game to get access to the page.

The user is to click on pairs of cards, constituting one move, until all 8 pairs are matched. The timer keeps track of time spent on the game, while the moves are displayed as well.

Once all matches are made, a modal box appears, giving the time, moves, and star rating of the performance. A star disappears at the 16, 24, and 30 marks, so that it is possible to achieve 0-3 stars. The round arrow on the page allows the user to reset/restart the game, either before completion, or after closing the statistic box.
